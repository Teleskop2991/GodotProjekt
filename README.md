This Collection is for showing some things, i did in my Godot Projekt

This Game is a 2D Top-Down Shooter, where you are able to controll a little floating tank, and Kill A LOT of Enemies.

I'm working on this for about 1.5 Month now. Currently i am developing a better Update System, with a Shop after each wave, where u can spend your Coins on some stat improvements.

I've added a easy adjustable wave-managment system, that makes it much easyer for me to ballance the hole game.


Things on the road yet to come:

1.More possible Updates variety

2.Coin visuals

3.Endboss to end the game
